# Going Live

Congratulations, you're close to going live with your website on lagoon!
In order to make this as seamless as possible this guide has been written.
It leads you trough the few things you should check before switching your site live.


## Check your .lagoon.yml

### Routes / SSL
Check if all Routes have been setup in the `.lagoon.yml`. Be aware that as long as you don't point the Domains towards
lagoon you should disable Let's Encrypt (LE) certificate creation as it will lead to issues and Domains not pointing
towards lagoon will be disabled after a while in order to not exceed the Let's Encrypt quotas.

If you use CA signed certificates you can set `tls-acme` to `false` but leave the `insecure` flag set to `Allow` or `Redirect`.
In the case of CA certificates let your lagoon administrator know the routes and the SSL certificate that needs to be put in place.

```
environments:
  master:
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - "example.com":
            tls-acme: 'false'
            insecure: Allow
        - "www.example.com":
            tls-acme: 'false'
            insecure: Allow
```

As soon as the DNS entries point towards your lagoon installation you can switch the flags:
`tls-acme` to `true` and `insecure` to `Redirect`

```
environments:
  master:
    routes:
      - nginx:
        - "example.com":
            tls-acme: 'true'
            insecure: Redirect
        - "www.example.com":
            tls-acme: 'true'
            insecure: Redirect
```

!!! hint
    As checking every page of your website might get a bit a tedious job you can make use of <a href="https://github.com/bramus/mixed-content-scan">mixed-content-scan</a>. This will crawl the entire site and give you back Sites that include assets from a non-https site.


### Redirects
If you need non-www to www redirects make sure you have them setup in the `redirects-map.conf` - [see Documentation](https://lagoon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_lagoon/docker_images/nginx/#redirects-mapconf)

### Cronjobs
Check if your cronjobs have been setup for your production environment - see [.lagoon.yml](lagoon_yml.md#environmentsnamecronjobs)

## DNS
To make it as easy as possible for you to get your site pointing to our servers we have dedicated load balancer DNS records. Those technical DNS resource records are used just for getting your site linked to the amazee.io infrastructure and serve no other purpose. If you are in doubt of the CNAME record ask your lagoon administrator about the exact CNAME you need to setup.

**Example on amazee.io :** `<loadbalancer-name>.<region-identifier>.amazee.io`

Before you switch over your domain to lagoon make sure you lower the Time-to-Live (TTL) before the golive. This will ensure
that the switch from the old to the new servers will go fast and quick. We usually advise a TTL of 300-600 seconds prior
to the DNS Switch. [More information about TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live#DNS_records)

!!! warning
    We do not suggest to configure any static IP address in your DNS Zones. As the lagoon loadbalancer infrastructure may change over time which can have impact on your site availability if you configured a static IP address.


### Root Domains
Configuring the root domain (e.g. example.com) can be a bit tricky because the DNS specification does not allow to have the root domain pointed to a CNAME entry. Depending on your DNS Provider the record name is different:

- ALIAS at [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/)
- ANAME at [DNS Made Easy](http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/)
- ANAME at [easyDNS](https://www.easydns.com/)
- ALIAS at [PointDNS](https://pointhq.com/)
- CNAME at [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
- CNAME at [NS1](http://ns1.com)

If your DNS Provider needs an IP address for the root domain - get in touch with your lagoon administrator to give you the load balancer IP addresses.

## Production environment
Lagoon has the concept of development and production environments. Development environments automatically send `noindex` and `nofollow`
headers in order to prohibit indexing by search engines.

``` X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow```

During Project setup the production environment should already be defined. If that's ommited your environment will run in
development mode. You can check if the environment is set as production environment in the lagoon user interface. If the
production environment is ot set let your lagoon administrator know they will configure the system accordingly.
